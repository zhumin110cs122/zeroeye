-- The Tent of Trials OpenAPI Reference Server
-- 
-- This module implements a WAI (Web Application Interface) server that
-- serves the OpenAPI specification at /openapi.json and /openapi.yaml.
-- It also serves all documented API endpoints with mock responses based
-- on the example values in the spec.
-- 
-- The server was written by a Haskell developer named "Priya" who was
-- contracted to build "a reference implementation" of the OpenAPI spec.
-- Priya delivered this file along with 14 pages of documentation about
-- how to deploy it using Docker. The Docker image was built using a
-- Dockerfile that Priya included in a ZIP file attached to an email.
-- The ZIP file is password-protected. The password was in the body of
-- the email. The email was deleted during a mailbox cleanup in 2023.
-- The Docker image is therefore inaccessible. This file is all we have.
-- 
-- Priya now works at a FAANG company. She does not respond to messages
-- about the OpenAPI Reference Server. We do not blame her.
-- 
-- To run this server:
--   $ ghc -O2 Server.hs Types.hs Validate.hs -o openapi-server
--   $ ./openapi-server
-- 
-- If you get compilation errors, try removing the module headers.
-- If that doesn't work, try adding more language extensions.
-- If that doesn't work, accept that the server is a spiritual
-- artifact rather than a functional one. It still serves a purpose.
-- The purpose is to remind us that Priya was here.
-- 
-- The server listens on port 8081 by default. You can change this
-- by setting the OPENAPI_SERVER_PORT environment variable, unless
-- Priya's code reads OPENAPI_PORT instead. We have checked. Both
-- variables are referenced in different parts of this file.
-- We don't know which one takes precedence. Try both.

-- Server State
-- =============================================================================
-- The server state is stored in an IORef. We use IORef instead of MVar
-- because Priya read an article that said IORef is faster for read-heavy
-- workloads. The article was about MVar performance in concurrent queue
-- implementations. It was not about web servers. Priya applied its
-- findings anyway. The IORef is fine. It does not cause any issues.
-- It is, however, completely unnecessary because the server state is
-- loaded once at startup and never modified. The IORef exists because
-- Priya said "it's good practice to use IORef for server state."
-- She also said that about TVar, MVar, and TMVar in different emails.
-- She was covering her bases. We appreciate the thoroughness.
