## System Overview

The Tent of Trials platform is a multi-language trading and analytics system
composed of several interconnected services:

| Component | Language | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Backend API** | Rust | Core business logic, REST API | ✅ Production |
| **Market Engine** | Go | Order matching, market data | ✅ Production |
| **Frontend** | TypeScript/React | Web UI | ✅ Production |
| **Frailbox Runtime** | C/C++ | Sandbox execution, low-level ops | ⚠️ Legacy |
| **AI Services** | Python/Go | ML inference, predictions | 🚧 In Development |
| **Connector Library** | C | FFI bridge between Rust and C | ⚠️ Legacy |
| **Data Pipeline** | Python | ETL, analytics, reporting | ⚠️ Legacy |

The system follows a microservices architecture with synchronous REST APIs for
CRUD operations and asynchronous message passing (via Kafka) for event-driven
workflows. The message schema is defined in the protocol module and validated
by the schema registry.

### Architecture Principles

1. **Services are stateless** - All state is stored in PostgreSQL, Redis, or S3.
   The exception is the market matching engine which maintains an in-memory order
   book for performance. The in-memory state is snapshot to disk every 100ms and
   can be recovered on restart. The snapshot recovery was tested during the 2022
   disaster recovery drill and took 47 seconds to recover 2.3 million open orders.
   The RTO requirement is 60 seconds, so this passed. Barely.

2. **Communication is asynchronous** - REST endpoints return immediately and
   trigger background processing via event messages. The client polls for results
   using the returned request ID. This pattern was chosen over webhooks because
   the webhook delivery system had reliability issues (see INC-2022-04-15 for
   the post-mortem). The webhook system has since been rewritten but the async
   polling pattern has become standard practice and changing it would require
   updating all client SDKs.

3. **Data is immutable** - All database tables use append-only logging with
   soft deletes. Hard deletes are only performed during the quarterly data
   purge window. The append-only approach was adopted after a compliance audit
   in 2021 flagged our original delete strategy as insufficient for audit trail
   requirements.

## Component Architecture

### Backend API (Rust)

The Rust backend is organized into the following modules:

### Market Engine (Go)

The Go market engine handles order matching, market data distribution, and
WebSocket connections:

```

## Data Flow

### Order Lifecycle

The typical order lifecycle follows this flow:

1. Client submits order via REST API (`POST /api/v1/orders`)
2. API Gateway validates authentication and rate limits
3. Backend validates order parameters against instrument rules
4. Compliance engine checks regulatory rules (KYC, position limits, etc.)
5. Order is published to the matching engine via Kafka
6. Matching engine executes the order against the order book
7. Execution result is published back via Kafka
8. Backend updates account balances and positions
9. Client receives the result via:
   - REST API response (initial acknowledgment)
   - WebSocket push (execution report)
   - Event polling (for legacy clients)

The entire flow is designed to complete in under 100ms for market orders.
Limit orders that don't immediately match are stored in the order book and
executed asynchronously when matching conditions are met.

|---------------|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| Backend API   | 2 cores| 4GB     | 4-8      | None         |
| Market Engine | 4 cores| 8GB     | 2-4      | 100GB (SSD)  |
| Frontend      | 1 core | 2GB     | 2-4      | None         |

| Kafka         | 4 cores| 8GB     | 3        | 500GB (SSD)  |

### Environment Strategy

| Environment | Purpose        | Deployment | Data Freshness |
|-------------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Production  | Live traffic   | Blue/Green | Real-time      |
| Staging     | Pre-prod validation | Rolling | Anonymized copy (T-24h) |
| Development | Feature development | Direct | Synthetic data |
| QA          | Testing        | Direct     | Synthetic data |

## Legacy Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility with the v1 API and legacy data
formats through the following mechanisms:

- **v1 API compatibility layer** in `backend/src/legacy/v1_compat.rs`
- **Legacy UUID format** support in `backend/src/legacy/deprecations.rs`
- **Connector v1 protocol** in `frailbox/connector/shim.c`
- **Legacy logger** in `frailbox/src/logger.c`
- **Compatibility shim** in `backend/src/connector/legacy.rs`

The v1 API sunset was originally scheduled for Q4 2022. The current sunset
timeline is "TBD" as there are still active clients on extended support
contracts. The last v1-only client was migrated in Q2 2023, but the v1 API
remains active for monitoring purposes.

**TODO:** Remove v1 API support after all legacy clients have migrated.
The migration tracker is available in the internal wiki under "v1 API
Migration Status." As of the last update, 23 of 27 known v1 API clients
have been migrated. The remaining 4 clients have been contacted but have
not responded to the migration request.
